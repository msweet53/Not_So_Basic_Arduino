# My Arduino Assignment

## Functions

### description:
Assignment that shows how to use functions in arduino

### Lessons Learned
- Functions are very helpful for long lengths of code that you are going to use multiple times.
- Always use the NewPing library for a ultrasonic sensor.
- Hard-Coding Ultrasonic sensors SUCKS! Gogle is your friend!

### How To Build:

## Hello_LCD

### description
Assignment that shows how to use an LCD screen with arduino.

### Lessons Learned
-Google is your friend!
-Use an LCD backpack!!!! All of that wiring is unneccesary!

## LCD_Backpack

### desciption
Assignment that shows hot to use an LCD backpack and how to code with its
library.

### Lessons Learned
- Using an LCD backpack is so much easier than wiring an LCD manually! espeially if you are not sticking it direcly to a breadboad!
- Again, GoOglE Is yoUR FrIenD!

### Lessons Learned
- GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND!
- Mr. H isn't the only peson who can help!

## NewPing

### description
Assignment that shows how to use an ultrasonic sensor with the NewPing
library on arduino.

### Lessons Learned
- Use the new ping library! Hard-coding an ultrasonic sensor sucks and NewPing has many different functions already coded for you!
- Look at the file that shows you the functions and there fucntions in the library!
